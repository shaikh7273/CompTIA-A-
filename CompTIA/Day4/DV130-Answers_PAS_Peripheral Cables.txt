Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What is one of the most common methods of connecting peripherals to computers? 
Ans: By using USB.

Q2. One of the early versions of USB was________, and it had ______different speeds.
Ans. Version 1.1 and 2 different speeds (1.5 mbit/s, 3 meters ; 12 mbit/s, 5 meters)

Q3. The early versions of USB had a low speed, which was _________megabits per second and a maximum cable length of around ________ meters.
Ans. 1.5 mbit/s and 3 meters length.

Q4. What is the maximum speed of USB 2.0? 
Ans: 480 mbit/s

Q5. What is USB 3.0? 
Ans: USB 3.0 is an upgrade to USB 2, and sometimes you’ll see it referred to as super speed USB

Q6. What are some common connectors from the USB 1.1 and 2.0 versions? 
Ans: Some common connectors from the USB 1.1 and 2.0 versions are the Standard-A plug, which is very similar to the standard-A plug you would find on most devices, the much larger standard-B plug, and then especially on mobile devices, we use the mini-B plug and the micro-B plug. 

Q7. The USB 3.0 micro-B plug is very different from the USB 2.0 version.(T/F)
Ans. True

Q8. What is the USB-C connector? 
Ans: the USB-C connector is very different than the A connectors that we’re used to using where you have to plug them in on exactly the right way to get them to work. With USB-C we simply plug-in the connector and there is no top or bottom it will work in either orientation. USB-C describes the connector itself, and does not describe the type of signal that you’re sending over that connection.

Q9. What is the maximum speed of USB 3.0? 
Ans: 5 gigabits per second.

Q10. How does USB 3.2 improve bandwidth? 
Ans:  This effectively doubles the bandwidth available in USB and uses USB C connectors to be able to provide that throughput. 

Q11. What is the size of the USB-C connector? 
Ans: The USB-C plug is slightly larger than the micro-B, but not by much. And you can see that it is symmetric, so That it’s able to work with any orientation.



Q12. What is the name of the USB 3.0 connection type? 
Ans: Super Speed Connector

Q13. What is an update of USB 3.0?
Ans. USB 3.1

Q14. What is the latest version of USB released in 2017? 
Ans: USB 3.2

Q15.The standard that used to be USB 3.0, which we change to _______Gen 1 is now called ______Gen 1 or superspeed USB __gigabits per second.  
Ans. USB 3.1 USB 3.1 Gen 1 and 5 gigabits per second.

Q16. What is the maximum throughput of USB 3.2 Gen 2 times 2?
 Ans: 20 gigabits per second.

Q17. What is Thunderbolt? 
Ans: This is a high speed serial connection that is able to put data and power on the same cable.

Q18. Thunderbolt version 1 is a________channel technology and you can put________ _gigabits per second over each of those channels for a maximum throughput of __________gigabits per second.
Ans.  2 ; 10 gigabits per second ; 20 gigabits per second.

Q19. What is the total aggregated throughput for a Thunderbolt version 3 connection? Ans: 40 gigabits per second

Q20. Thunderbolt signals can be set over both ______or _________ connections. 
Ans. copper or fiber connections.

Q21. What is the maximum length of a Thunderbolt connection? 
Ans: Copper - 3 meters ; Fiber / Optical - 60 meters.

Q22. How many Thunderbolt devices can be daisy-chained together? 
Ans: 6

Q23. Before we had a universal serial bus, we were using _____ pin and ____ pin serial connections on our computers to be able to connect peripherals.
Ans. 9 and 25 pin

Q24. What type of connectors were used before the invention of the Universal Serial Bus? 
Ans: DB-9 or DB-25
