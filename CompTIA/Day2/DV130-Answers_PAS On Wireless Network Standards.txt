17. What is RFID?
Ans: Radio-frequency Identification
	
18. How does RFID work?
Ans: RFID stands for radio-frequency identification, and is a vital part of modern tracking, location, and identification technologies. It uses electromagnetic fields to identify and track RFID tags. These tags are small and can be attached to people, machines, electronic devices, vehicles, or any other physical object. RFID tags act as intelligent barcodes that can be scanned to identify and obtain information about the RFID tag.
