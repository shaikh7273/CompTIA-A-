Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. What is a 3D printer? 
Ans: There’s a new style of printing that you might use called a 3D printer that prints in three dimensions.

Q2. 3D printer that prints in ____________ dimensions. 
Ans. 3

Q3. We often refer to 3D printers as a ____________________.
Ans. Additive Manufacturing

Q4. What do we do to create a 3D model?
Ans. We’re creating layers upon layers to finally create the 3D model that you see in the final output.

Q5. What is additive manufacturing? 
Ans: You create an electronic model, you provide that to the printer, and it’s able to provide you with output that you could hold in your hand.


Q6. What are 3D printers being used for? 
Ans:  Not only are we using these 3D printers around the world to be able to quickly create objects. We’re also using 3D printers in space. The International Space Station has a 3D printer.

Q7. What is a very common type of 3D printing? 
Ans: Filament Printing

Q8. What does FDM stand for?
Ans. Fused Deposition Modeling

Q9. Explain filament printing?
Ans. A very common type of 3D printing is called filament printing. You’ll sometimes hear this referred to as fused deposition modeling, or FDM. With filament printing, we are melting the filament and placing it in very fine layers to create the 3D object. The print head will use the filament to print one layer on the object, move up a bit, print the next layer, and so on.


Q10. What are the advantages of using this type of 3D printer? 
Ans: It has a very large print bed. You can manage the filament very easily because it’s something that’s easy to be transported or put into the printer. This doesn’t make much of a mess because we’re dealing with these long strands of hard filament. This is also something that’s very easy to dispose of because you don’t have much mess left over once you’ve created that 3D object.

Q11. How does the filament printer create 3D objects? 
Ans. The filament then goes all the way to the top of the printer, where it connects with the print head. And as it’s melted, it’s able to create the 3D object.


Q12. How does an SLA printer differ from a filament printer? 
Ans. This type of printing tends to work in reverse to what you just saw with the filament printers. There’s liquid resin that sits on the bottom of this printer, and the object that you’re printing is attached to a build platform that moves up and down. This build platform moves down into the liquid resin, where a light, usually an ultraviolet light or a laser, is used to Harden this resin to create another layer at the bottom of this object. This build platform then moves up a bit to get rid of any excess resin and then moves back down into the resin where the process begins again with the light source hardening the next layer on this object.

Q13. What does an SLA printer stand for?
Ans. Stereolithography Printer

Q14. SLA Printer is often referred to as_____________.
Ans. Resin Printer

Q15. How does SLA printers work?
Ans. This type of printing tends to work in reverse to what you just saw with the filament printers. There’s liquid resin that sits on the bottom of this printer, and the object that you’re printing is attached to a build platform that moves up and down. This build platform moves down into the liquid resin, where a light, usually an ultraviolet light or a laser, is used to Harden this resin to create another layer at the bottom of this object. This build platform then moves up a bit to get rid of any excess resin and then moves back down into the resin where the process begins again with the light source hardening the next layer on this object.

Q16. There’s __________that sits on the bottom of this SLA printer, and the object that you’re printing is attached to a ___________that moves up and down.
Ans. Liquid Resin ; Build Platform

Q17. What is the biggest challenge with resin printing? 
Ans: The biggest challenge with resin printing tends to revolve around how you manage this liquid resin.

Q18. You have to use_______________, so that you don’t injure yourself when working with the resin.
Ans.  Protective Gear

Q19. What should you do with leftover resin? 
Ans:  And if there’s any resin left over or any resin that you need to dispose of, then you have to take that to a hazardous materials facility in your area.


Q20. What do we refer to as the large surface used for 3D printing? 
Ans: Prinet Bed

Q21. _________________ is a flat surface, and it usually is either adhesive on the bottom with your filament printing or adhesive on the top, so that you’re able to connect it to the build platform with resin printing.
Ans. Prinet Bed

Q22. What needs to be done to the print bed to ensure a successful print? 
Ans: Everything on this print bed needs to be completely level, it needs to be clean, and anything that we’re printing on this needs to stay completely still during the printing process.

Q23. What is the print bed for filament printing? 
Ans: Adhesive

Q24. What is the print bed typically made of? 
Ans:  That’s why this print bed is usually created from something that is relatively sticky or makes it very difficult for that object to move

Q25. Are there different options for print beds? 
Ans: Yes there are.


Q26. What is the print bed in resin printing? 
Ans: With resin printing, the print bed is the very small area at the bottom of this printer where the light is able to harden the resin.
